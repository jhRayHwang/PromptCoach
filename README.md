PROMPT COACH

Welcome to Prompt Coach! Our mission is to empower everyday users of large language models (LLMs) by making prompt writing more transparent, safe, and effective. We aim to build a tool that analyzes the emotional tone of user prompts, helping prevent biased, misleading, or emotionally charged AI responses. Emotionally charged prompts are those that contain intense affective language, frustration, or implicit bias, which can unintentionally lead LLMs to produce exaggerated or emotionally reactive outputs. These kinds of responses can amplify issues of misinformation, reinforce stereotypes, or derail the user's original intent. By flagging this content, our project aims to help users reframe their prompts for more accurate outputs.  

This project is created as part of the INFO 492: Intensive Capstone course at the University of Washington.
